  Download Genuine Installation Media: (Windows /Office /Server - .ISO .IMG .ESD .EXE and UUP files)
__________________________________________________________________________________________________________

 - Basic info:

   - Officially there are 3 sources to get the .ISO's.
     MVS (formerly MSDN), VLSC, and Techbench
   - MVS and VLSC requires a subscription to download the .ISO's, but Techbench links are public.
     There is no official and easy to use site for all Techbench links.

   - MVS = VLSC = Techbench 
     They all have identical .ISO's, and it’s only their names that are different.

     Some file naming examples -
     Techbench - Win10_1809Oct_English_x64.ISO
     MVS       - en_windows_7_professional_with_sp1_vl_build_x86_dvd_u_677896.ISO
     VLSC      - SW_DVD9_Win_Embed_Industry_ENT_8.1_64Bit_English_-3_MLF_X19-82965.ISO

     File names explained https://www.betaarchive.com/forum/viewtopic.php?t=26026

     Techbench hosts Retail .ISO's.
     MVS hosts both Retail and Volume .ISO's.
     VLSC hosts Volume .ISO's.

 - Official method (Public Links):

   - Windows 7
     https://www.microsoft.com/software-download/windows7

   - Windows 8.1
     https://www.microsoft.com/software-download/windows8ISO
     You can directly download the .ISO's from here.

   - Windows 11
     https://www.microsoft.com/software-download/windows11
     You can directly download the .ISO's from here.

   - Windows 10
     https://www.microsoft.com/software-download/windows10

     By default it doesn't provide the .ISO to Windows OS users directly, but instead provides a tool 
     named 'Media Creation Tool' which then CREATES the .ISO (which means their .ISO can't be verified
     by using a hash) which is based on ESD. To get the direct .ISO file you have to change the 
     browser user agent to some other operating system than Windows. (an .ISO created with the Media 
     Creation Tool is smaller than the directly downloaded .ISO)

   - Office
     Office .ISO links requires a log in and keys to download the .ISO. 
     However, Office .ISO links are static. Below, is a partial list of places where you can download 
     Office ISO easily.

     This collection offers major Windows, Server, and Office (Including VL and retail) 
     .ISO in all languages. This collection uses the SVF method to create .ISO’s.

     How to use .svf?
     As an example, if you want to download an .ISO of a French language version of Office 2010 
     SP1 Pro Vl, you first have to download a full-size English .ISO, and then after that's done, 
     download a small-size French .svf file.
     Following that, put English .ISO, French svf file and tool (SVF-extractor) into a folder all 
     together. Then use the extract option in the tool, and it will generate an original French 
     language .ISO.

 - Alternatives for the original ISO:

   - ESD to ISO (Windows 8.1 and 10)
     In this method, a ESD file (which is verifiable) is converted to the full ISO (which can not be 
     verified). This method is similar to the official 'Media Creation Tool' ISO creation process.

   Techbench - No list available, manually needs to be calculated.
