====================================================================================================
   [HWID] Digital License Activation:
====================================================================================================

 - This activation is supported for Windows 10/11 ONLY.
 - This activation does not store any files in your system.
 - This activation is a permanent activation for your system Hardware.

 - On a system, this activation can be created for all the supported editions, and all can be 
   linked to Microsoft account without any issues.

 - Once a system is activated, this activation cannot be removed. (Because the license is stored in 
   the Microsoft servers and not in the user's system.)

 - Any significant changes in the Hardware (such as a motherboard) may deactivate the system. 
   It is possible to reactivate a system that was deactivated because of significant hardware
   changes, IF your activation, was linked to an online Microsoft account.

 - For activation to succeed, the Windows Update Service and internet connectivity must be enabled.
   If you are trying to activate without these conditions being met, then the system will auto-
   activate later when the conditions are met.

 - Auto activation scenario after the Windows reinstall:
   - The Internet is required. (Only at the time of activation)
   - The system will auto-activate if Retail (Consumer) media was used for the installation.
   - The system will NOT auto-activate if VL (Business) media was used for the installation.
     In this case, the user will have to insert that windows edition Retail/OEM key (find keys below
     in this page) to activate, if the user doesn't wish to activate again using this script.

 - Possible reasons for activation failure:
   - The Internet is not connected.
   - Windows update service is disabled.
   - Use of a VPN, and/or a privacy-based hosts file, firewall rules.
   - Corrupt system files.
   - Microsoft servers block the activation request from some countries such as Iran.
   - Rarely, Microsoft's activation servers are the problem.
   - Some machines are not able to generate GenuineTicket.xml file using gatherosstate.exe
     The reason is unknown (to me). Please contact me if it happens to you.

   * Check Troubleshoot Script in the "Extras" section if you are facing issues with activation.

 - Check Extract OEM option in the "Extras" section if you want pre-activated Windows installation.

====================================================================================================
   Downlevel and Lockbox Ticket for HWID:
====================================================================================================

   Downlevel = downlevelGTkey
   Lockbox   = clientLockboxKey

   Downlevel Method:
   It creates downlevelGTkey ticket for activation with simplest process.
   
   LockBox Method:
   It creates clientLockboxKey ticket which better mimics genuine activation,
   But requires more steps such as,
   - Cleaning ClipSVC licences
   - Deleting a volatile and protected registry key by taking ownership
   HKLM\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion\ClipSVC\Volatile\PersistedSystemState
   - System may need a restart for succesfull activation
   - Microsoft Account and Store Apps may need relogin-restart in the system

   Further read: https://massgrave.dev/readme-activation-faq.html

   Note:
   Microsoft accepts both types of tickets and that's unlikely to change.
   If you are not sure what to choose then select default Downlevel Method.

   Switches for the Script (Separate Files Version):
====================================================================================================

 - To activate with Downlevel method (default), run the script with /a parameter
"HWID_Activation.cmd" /a

 - To only generate GenuineTicket.xml with Downlevel method (default), run the script with /g parameter
"HWID_Activation.cmd" /g

 - To enable LockBox method, run the script with /k parameter
   You need to use this option with either activation or ticket generation. 
   Example,
"HWID_Activation.cmd" /a /k
"HWID_Activation.cmd" /g /k

====================================================================================================
   Manual Activation Process:
====================================================================================================

 - Prerequisite:

   For Windows 10-11 x86-x64 system, you need following files, (Get it from MAS separate files version)
   gatherosstate.exe
   slc.dll

   For Windows 10 ARM64 system, you need following files,
   arm64_gatherosstate.exe
   arm64_slc.dll
   * Rename the ARM64 files to gatherosstate.exe and slc.dll respectively.

   Make a folder named 'Files' in C drive, [C:\Files] and copy the required files in that folder.

   -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 - Make sure the Windows Update Service and internet are both enabled.
 - Open a command prompt (run cmd.exe) as administrator, and enter following listed commands in the 
   the sequence in which they are given.
 - Enter Retail/OEM Key, (Replace '%key%' with the key from the above list) with the following command:

cscript /nologo %windir%\system32\slmgr.vbs /ipk %key%

 - Make sure slc.dll and gatherosstate.exe files are located in the folder, "C:\Files" and enter 
   the following commands to generate GenuineTicket.xml file.

   For x86-x64 systems,

pushd "C:\Files"
rundll32 "C:\Files\slc.dll",PatchGatherosstate
call "C:\Files\gatherosstatemodified.exe"

 - Now a GenuineTicket.xml file should be created in the folder "C:\Files\", copy and paste this file in the 
   folder named, "C:\ProgramData\Microsoft\Windows\ClipSVC\GenuineTicket\"

 - Now apply this ticket using the following commands in this sequence:

net stop ClipSVC
net start ClipSVC

 - Activate Windows with the following command:

cscript /nologo %windir%\system32\slmgr.vbs /ato

 - Check Activation Status with the following command:

cscript /nologo %windir%\system32\slmgr.vbs /xpr

 - Done.

   * Note - [clipup -v -o -altto <ticket_path>] method to apply the ticket was not suggested because
            of the issues in case the username have spaces or non English characters.
