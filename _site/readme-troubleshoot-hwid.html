 HWID Activation Troubleshoot:
________________________________

 - Make sure you are using the latest version of the activator, to check it, browse the links listed 
   in the bottom of this page.

 - Make sure the internet is connected.

 - If the HWID Activation script showed error about Windows Update service (wuauserv), then make 
   sure any update blocking tools or script is not in action in the system. You need to check it
   and unblock windows update with that same tool.

 - VPN, privacy-based hosts and/or firewall rules may cause problems with the activation. Disable 
   them if you are facing problems in activation.

 - Reboot the system.

 - Now run the script to activate Windows 10-11, and if unsuccessful, 
   Try the troubleshoot button in the Settings > Update & Security > Activation, page.
   
 - If still unsuccessful and you want to try another activator then use,
   'WinActivate' by @Luzea  https://github.com/luzeadev/winactivate

   Tip - Don't start to search and use other unknown tools found on unreliable sites via google search 
   result, they may (some already do) ruin your system with malwares.

 - If still unsuccessful then try additional troubleshoot steps listed below.
_______________________________________________________________________________________________________

   update for drivers.

 - Apply: [4] Dism RestoreHealth

   Reboot the system

   Reboot the system (If error found in SFC Scan, run the scan again) and run the activation script, 
   and if unsuccessful, 

 - Apply: [6] Windows Rearm - Specific SKU ID

 - Microsoft servers block the activation request from some countries such as Iran,

     the location of the USA. Now run the script, it should activate now.

 - Some machines are not able to generate GenuineTicket.xml file using gatherosstate.exe
   The reason is unknown (to me). Please contact me if it happens to you.
