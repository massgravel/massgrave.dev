# Licensing Servers Issue

-   In some cases, **HWID activation** may fail because the system couldn't connect to HWID licensing servers.
-   The activation script will inform you about this if that is the case. We suggest following the below guide only when the script tells you to do so.

## VPN

-   Install [Freedome](https://download.sp.f-secure.com/freedome/installer/2/Freedome.exe) VPN, connect, and try HWID activation.
-   If the VPN is not connecting, use another Internet connection such as your Mobile phone through USB Tethering or Wi-Fi Hotspot, and try HWID activation.
-   If HWID activation is still not working then check [here](troubleshoot.md) for help.
