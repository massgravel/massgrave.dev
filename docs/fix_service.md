## Corrupt service - Null 

- The script may show that `Null service is not running, script may crash...` 
- Follow these steps only if the script crashes after that.
- Download and extract this Null service registry [file](https://buzzheavier.com/cbdn9apnz4tj).
- Run the file, restart the system (using the restart button), and try the activation script again.
- If the issue persists, check if you are using `Comodo Antivirus` or any type of `sandboxing` security software. If so, temporarily disable it and run the script again.
