#### Is MAS safe?
- #### How can I tell if there is any malware?
  MAS is fully [open source](intro.md#mas-latest-release), with over 140K stars on [GitHub](https://github.com/massgravel/Microsoft-Activation-Scripts) and millions of users worldwide. You can open the batch files in Notepad to review the code yourself or ask ChatGPT for help if you don’t understand something in the scripts.  
  You can also perform the activation manually; see [this page](manual_hwid_activation.md) for instructions.

- #### Will I receive updates? How is it different from an official license?
  MAS does not interfere with Windows or Office updates. It functions the same way as official licensing methods.

- #### Will Microsoft ban my account if I use MAS?
  No. Windows and Office piracy have existed for decades, and Microsoft has never banned accounts solely for this reason.

- #### Is it legal? Can I face any consequences?
  - By using MAS, you bypass official licensing methods and do not pay Microsoft, so technically it is not legal.
  - Is it safe?  
    - **Home users:** Yes - it's safe. Piracy has existed for decades, and Microsoft does not take action against individuals who pirate Windows or Office. Pursuing a home user over a $100–$200 license would cost more in legal fees than it could recover and risks bad publicity. At most, you may see notifications that your license is not genuine (with MAS, these notifications do not appear). 
    - **Businesses:** We do not recommend that businesses use MAS. Microsoft conducts audits of business entities to verify licenses. While small businesses might be less likely to face audits, the risk remains. If you work in IT at a college or university, consult experienced senior staff about the likelihood of Microsoft audits at your institution.

Yes. Use the Ohook activation option. However, you won't get server-side O365-specific features such as 1 TB of OneDrive storage, though almost all other features and the 5 GB free OneDrive storage will work fine.

Some features require signing in with a Microsoft account (free) in the Office apps.

#### Can I get Python in Excel with MAS activation?
No. [Python in Excel](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/office/introduction-to-python-in-excel-55643c2e-ff56-4168-b1ce-9428c8308545) is a server-side feature. To get it, you need a Microsoft 365 subscription.

---

#### How can I donate or contribute to the project?
The MASSGRAVE project doesn't accept donations and it's free.  
Because it's a community project with many contributors, splitting donations is not practical, and profiting from piracy is not good.

However, if you would like to contribute in nonfinancial ways, please visit [this page](contribute.md) for more information.
