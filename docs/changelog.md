------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 2.6

## 2.4

**Minor Update**

------------------------------------------------------------------------

#### Ohook:

-   Separate files version for Ohook script is changed to AIO.

-   Users don't need to update their Ohook installation with this update.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 2.1

**HWID Activation is not working**

------------------------------------------------------------------------

#### HWID:

-   Added info for activation not working issue.\
    It's not working because of server-side changes at Microsoft. Use the KMS38 option for now. Your previously established HWID is safe.

#### Ohook:

-   Change the key preference for Office products in this order `Retail:TB:Sub > Retail > OEM:NONSLP > Volume:MAK > Volume:GVLK`

-   The script is updated as per @abbodi1406 KVA v50. Changes:
    -   Fixed conversion for Office 2016 C2R Retail previously, the first run mistakenly said conversion had failed, even though it was successful (due to confusion with Office 2019 licenses/location detection)
    -   Added support for activating Windows 10 IoT Enterprise LTSC 2021 (LCU 19044.2788 or later)

#### Change Windows Edition:

-   Script will use @ave9858 (Alex) DISM API method instead of changepk.exe method to change from Windows 10/11 Core to Non-core (e.g. Home to Pro) Advantages: Internet doesn't need to be disabled, all OEM/GVLK key restrictions are removed, and better error output
-   Script will only use best methods to change edition instead of showing multiple choices

#### Troubleshoot:

-   Script will compress large log files to cab instead of deleting and creating them fresh in DISM restore and SFC scan options
-   WMI fix is improved

#### All:

-   Insert HWID key script is removed because it's not important and causes confusion

   activating another machines when same backup is used in restoring process.
 - gatherosstate.exe is changed to 14393 version, size is quite small. Also HWID/KMS38 scripts now shares 
   same "Files" folder files.

   @ALL:

## 0.9

```         
   HWID and KMS38

 - Modified file "gatherosstateLTSB15.exe" (For HWID) has been converted to text using 
   'Compressed 2 txt' by AveYo https://github.com/AveYo/Compressed2TXT to avoid
   the possible AV's detection. This file will be extracted in only LTSB 2015 Activation.
 - Added ClipSVC tokens Rebuilding (by default) (Thanks to @s1ave77 for the idea)
   (To solve the issue when system image is used on different machines)
 - Added service checks for ClipSVC, wlidsvc (Not in KMS38), and sppsvc (Thanks to @s1ave77 for the idea)
 - Added reattempts for ticket generation and activation.
 - Added new keys for 1903 server releases (For KMS38)
 - KMS38 script can now unlock the 180 days KMS lock without using full Rearm and Restart.
   Now it'll apply the SKU-APP ID rearm if required. (Idea taken from the @Ratiborus Tools)
 - Added a separate KMS38 protection script to protect the KMS38 activation from being overrun by 
   180 days KMS Activators by accident or even on purpose.
   (Thanks to @AveYo aka @BAU for the Reg_takeownership snippet pastebin.com/XTPt0JSC)


   Online KMS

 - Renewal task function has been removed to avoid the possible AV's detection.
   Because AV's suspect the background task but same codes can be run just fine in the foreground.
   In replacement I've added the Desktop context menu entry for the script for easy manual renewal in case if registered 
   server goes down, and just FYI added server in the script are running from approx 3 years without problems
   and user would need to run the script for renewal after 180 days when the registered server goes down.
 - Updated the script to KMS_VL_ALL 32 beta https://forums.mydigitallife.net/threads/kms_vl_all-smart-activation-script.79535/
   (Imp - Now script will retry to activate in case of failed activation, it increases it's reliability very much)
   (Thanks to @abbodi1406 for the update)
 - Now KMS servers will be tested on the Port 1688 with powershell instead of ping for more accuracy.
   (Thanks to @RPO for the codes)
 - Added appropriate colors in activation output.


   ALL

 - Added powershell codes for the admin auto elevation with parameters capability. 
   (Thanks to @AveYo aka @BAU for the codes)
 - Added /u parameter for the unattended run instead of changing the value in script.
 - For those scripts which may need to provide the long output, I've added powershell snippet 
   to keep the window height fixed with long buffer size capability.
   (Thanks to @dbenham for the codes https://stackoverflow.com/a/13351373)
 - Updated the ReadMe's with the Activation info regarding How it works? and Is it safe to use? and possible issues users might face.

  Thanks to @sponpa for the new ideas and codes https://tinyurl.com/y24dbdmw 
  and Thanks to @leitek8 for the further improvements http://tinyurl.com/y2a98rlk
  Users can easily compile the slc.dll file. Thanks to @leitek8 for providing the instructions.
- HWID and KMS38 activation now use the Windows 10 17134 ADK gatherosstate.exe file.Process is quite fast now. Thanks to @sponpa for the idea.
  For LTSB 2015, script uses the mod gatherosstate.exe file from the @angelkyo open source tool https://gitlab.com/angelkyo/w10-digitallicense
- Added following editions for the KMS38 activation.

  EnterpriseG
  EnterpriseGN  
  ServerCloudStorage     [Server 2016]
  ServerDatacenter       [Server 2016 & 2019]
  ServerDatacenterCor    [Server 2016 & 2019]
  ServerSolution         [Server 2016 & 2019]
  ServerSolutionCor      [Server 2016 & 2019]
  ServerStandard         [Server 2016 & 2019]
  ServerStandardCor      [Server 2016 & 2019]
  ServerDatacenterACor   [Server Version 1709 & 1803 & 1809]
  ServerStandardACor     [Server Version 1709 & 1803 & 1809]

- To activate server *cor and *acor editions with KMS38, added the required clipup.exe file from the server 2016 iso in the Files folder.
- In KMS38, instead of clearing global KMS IP, script now set specific KMS host IP to the localhost 127.0.0.2
  The advantage of doing this is that, It helps KMS38 remain untouched from the global KMS IP but other products can still use the global IP.
  Thanks to @abbodi1406 for the help.
- Digital license script now hide the Activation cmd error output. (Never show any useful info)
- Scripts now check the following problematic characters in the File Path Name. Thanks to @Jeb for the code and @abbodi1406 for the help.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 0.7

```         
To further make sure that script is clean from av's, following changes were made,

- Multipurpose big scripts are not friendly to the AV's, so i've separated all the scripts.
- Now files are not converted to the text, they are added as they are. (because av's 'may' find text to file suspicious)
- Now scripts asks users to manually run the file as administrator .
- Made sure that all custom vbs use have been removed.

(Above changes reduced the user friendliness of the script, but my main priority in maintaining this fork is to 
create activators which are AV friendly, and these steps were required to achieve that.)

Some more changes - 

- Digital license script now checks for Internet and update service, and changes the update service status if required  
  and after the activation it put it back as it were previously.
- Changed the Mod gatherosstate files with the files from hwid.kms38.gen.mk6.exe v55.01 https://www.nsaneforums.com/topic/312871--/ 
  by @s1ave77.
  (p.s. To adopt the new files of v60.01, i should wait atleast a month to know the av's stable detection rate)
- KMS38 scripts now show a prompt to the users before applying rearm and restart.
- Errors are highlighted in red color in Digital license and KMS38 scripts.
- Removed the options, Insert Windows 10 GVLK and Change Windows 10 Edition (GVLK) (Not very useful)

  scripts works fine in all parts of the world.
