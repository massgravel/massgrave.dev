# $OEM$ Folders

To create a pre-activated Windows installation ISO, do the following:
-   Extract the `$OEM$` folder to the desktop using the MAS script.
-   Copy the `$OEM$` folder to the `sources` folder in the Windows installation media (ISO or USB).
-   The directory will appear like this: `\sources\$OEM$` in your altered ISO or on your bootable USB drive.
-   Now use this ISO or bootable USB drive to install Windows, it will either already be activated (KMS38) as soon as it boots or will self-activate (HWID or Online KMS) at the first internet contact.
-   You can check [here](intro.md) for activation method details.

:::warning

-   On Windows 8 and later, [**running setupcomplete.cmd is disabled**](https://learn.microsoft.com/windows-hardware/manufacture/desktop/add-a-custom-script-to-windows-setup?view=windows-11#windows-setup-scripts) if the default installed key for the edition is from the OEM channel, except for Enterprise editions and Windows Server operating systems.
-	However, in Windows 10, IoT Enterprise editions were not included in the Enterprise category list during the installation process. As a result, Enterprise with an OEM key can handle setupcomplete.cmd, but IoT Enterprise (LTSC) cannot. This was fixed in later Windows 11 versions.
-   In Windows 10 IoT Enterprise (LTSC), you can resolve this issue by using the Non-IoT Windows 10 Enterprise LTSC ISO. In this case, the HWID method in preactivation will install the IoT LTSC key to change the edition and enable HWID activation.  
-   In Windows 11 IoT Enterprise (LTSC), it works fine as expected by default.

## Edit ISO File

-   As stated above, you can copy the `$OEM$` folder to your bootable USB so you don't have to edit the ISO file. However, if you need to, then follow the steps below.
-   Download [AnyBurn Free Portable](https://www.anyburn.com/download.php) and extract this zip file
-   Run the file named `AnyBurn(64-bit)\AnyBurn.exe`
-   Select the option named `Edit image file`
-   Follow the on-screen instructions and add the `$OEM$` folder to the `sources` folder so that the directory will appear like this: `\sources\$OEM$`
-   Save the ISO, that's it.

## KMS38 - Server Cor/Acor

-   Windows Server Cor/Acor (No GUI) editions don't have the `clipup.exe` file.
-   To KMS38 activate it, you need to download the missing `ClipUp.exe` file from [this link](https://app.box.com/s/cwoxub9tqyowhnyva6ign6qnogb6vk0o).  
    `File: ClipUp.exe`  
    `SHA-256: 0d6e9f6bbd0321eda149658d96040cb4f79e0bd93ba60061f25b28fecbf4d4ef`  
    This file has digital signatures that can be verified. You can also get this file from the official [Windows Server 2016 x64 RTM ISO](https://download.microsoft.com/download/1/6/F/16FA20E6-4662-482A-920B-1A45CF5AAE3C/14393.0.160715-1616.RS1_RELEASE_SERVER_EVAL_X64FRE_EN-US.ISO).
-   Put the `ClipUp.exe` beside the KMS38 Activation script. That would be either `MAS_AIO.cmd` or `KMS38_Activation.cmd`
-   The activation script will check `ClipUp.exe` in the current folder (from where script is running) and will use it accordingly.

##  Preinstall Office

-	Follow this [guide](https://gravesoft.dev/office_c2r_custom) and download the Office files.
- 	Copy the downloaded `Office` folder, `setup.exe` and `Configuration.xml` files, and paste them into the $OEM$ folder, beside the `setupcomplete.cmd` file.
-	Open the `setupcomplete.cmd` file with notepad and add the below lines after `fltmc >nul || exit /b` line.
	```
	cd /d "%~dp0"
	setup.exe /configure Configuration.xml
	```
- 	Save the $OEM$ folder into the ISO as per above instructions, that's it.

## HWID

-   When using HWID activation, no files are stored on the system, and Windows 10-11 will be activated when connected to the internet for the first time.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Ohook

-   If Office is preinstalled then Ohook method will activate the Office immediately without Internet. This activation uses custom sppc.dll file for the activation.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## TSforge

-   When using TSforge activation, no files are stored on the system, and Windows / ESU / Office (preinstalled) becomes activated immediately without Internet.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## KMS38

-   When using KMS38 activation, no files are stored on the system, and Windows 10-11-Server becomes activated immediately without Internet.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Online KMS

-   When using Online KMS activation, Windows-Server and Office (Preinstalled) both will be activated when connected to the internet for the first time. This option uses a renewal task for lifetime activation.

## HWID + Ohook

-   In this method, Windows 10-11 will be activated with HWID, and **Office** (Preinstalled) will be activated using Ohook.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## HWID + Ohook + TSforge

-   In this method, Windows 10-11 will be activated with HWID, and **Office** (Preinstalled) will be activated using Ohook and Windows ESU will be activated with TSforge.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## TSforge + Online KMS

-   In this method, Windows will be activated with TSforge, and **Office** (Preinstalled) will be activated using Online KMS. This combination is best for Windows 7 because Office on Windows 7 isn't supported by TSforge.
