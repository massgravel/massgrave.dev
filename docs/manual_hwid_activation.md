# Manual Windows Activation (HWID)

This page is for people who do not want to use the script for any reason and would rather perform the HWID activation process themselves. If you'd like to use a tool for this, please check [here](intro.md#download--how-to-use-it).

## Manually Activate Windows
-   Make sure you have a working internet connection.
-   Open Windows PowerShell as Administrator.
-   Determine your Windows Edition. You can find this by searching for "About your PC" in the start menu.
-   Download the appropriate ticket file from the table below; the ticket file must match your Windows edition.
-   Copy the downloaded ticket file and paste it into the following folder:  
    `C:\ProgramData\Microsoft\Windows\ClipSVC\GenuineTicket`
-   Open the Windows Activation settings and click the "Change product key" button.
-   Copy the corresponding product key from the table below and paste it into the product key field.
-   After waiting for a few seconds, Windows should be activated.
