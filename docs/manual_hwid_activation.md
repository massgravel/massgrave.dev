# HWID

This page is for people who do not want to use the script for any reason and would rather perform the HWID activation process themselves. If you'd like to use a tool for this, please check [here](intro.md#download--how-to-use-it).

:::info
HWID activation is only supported on Windows 10/11.
:::

## Manually Activate Windows
To manually activate Windows, follow these steps:
-   Make sure you have a working internet connection.
-   Determine your Windows Edition. You can find this by searching for "About your PC" in the start menu.
-   Download the appropriate ticket file from the table below; the ticket file must match your Windows edition.
-   Copy the downloaded ticket file to the folder:  
    `C:\ProgramData\Microsoft\Windows\ClipSVC\GenuineTicket`
    If you can't find the `ProgramData` folder, that is because it is hidden by default.
    An alternative way to access it is to copy the full path into the Windows Explorer address bar at the top and press enter.
-   Open the Windows Activation settings and click the "Change product key" button.
-   Copy the corresponding product key from the table below and paste it into the product key field.
-   After waiting for a few seconds, Windows should be activated.
