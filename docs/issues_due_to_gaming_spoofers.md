# Issues Due To Gaming Spoofers

## Incorrect ModuleId

MAS activation may show the error related to "Incorrect ModuleId". Some gaming spoofers mess with Windows activation-related registry keys and because of that windows can not be activated. To fix this, you just need to restore that corrupt registry key with default data.

-   [Download](/files/spp_pro.zip) and run this registry file, and confirm all prompts.
-   Restart your system.
-   Run the activation in MAS and if the issue is still not resolved, connect with us [here](troubleshoot.md).
