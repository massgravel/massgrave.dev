# Issues Due To Gaming Spoofers

## Incorrect ModuleId

MAS activation may show an error related to "Incorrect ModuleId". Some gaming spoofers modify Windows activation-related registry keys, which can prevent Windows from activating. To fix this, restore the corrupt registry key with the default data.
