These instructions are written in context of Activation Troubleshoot option in MAS.

________________________________

 KMS38 Activation Troubleshoot:
________________________________

 - Make sure you are using the latest version of the activator, to check it, browse the links listed 
   in the bottom of this page.

 - Make sure to completely remove any previously-installed KMS activators if any exist, before 
   applying KMS38 activation.

 - Reboot the system.

 - Now run the script to activate Windows, and if unsuccessful, 
   Try the troubleshoot button in the Settings > Update & Security > Activation, page.

 - If still unsuccessful and you want to try another activator then use,
   'WinActivate' by @Luzea  https://github.com/luzeadev/winactivate

   Tip - Don't start to search and use other unknown tools found on unreliable sites via google search 
   result, they may (some already do) ruin your system with malwares.

 - If still unsuccessful then try additional troubleshoot steps listed below.
