   Online KMS Activation:
====================================================================================================

 - This Online KMS Activation script,

   - is a fork of @abbodi1406's KMS_VL_ALL Script  forums.mydigitallife.net/posts/838808
     this fork's purpose is to avoid having any KMS binary files and activate Windows / Office using 
     only transparent batch script with online public KMS servers IP (Not hostname).

   - activate Windows / Office for 180 Days, for Core / ProWMC editions it is 30/45 Days. 
   - can activate both Retail and VL Windows installation.
   - can activate C2R Retail and VL Office, but not 2010/2013 MSI Retail Office and UWP Office. 
   - skip the activation of any permanently / KMS38 activated product.

   As mentioned, it activates only for a limited period and it's not permanent, read below on how 
   to achieve lifetime activation.

____________________________________________________________________________________________________

   Activation Renewal:
_______________________________________

 - By design in the KMS activation method, the system contacts the registered server every 7 
   days, and if contacted successfully it will automatically renew and reset the activation for the 
   the full period of 180 days again, starting from the day of successful contact.
   If the system cannot contact the server, it will be deactivated after 180 days and it will 
   remain deactivated until contact can be restored.

 - To get the lifetime activation, you either need to create an automatic renewal task, or manually
   renew the activation whenever required.

   There are 3 ways you can renew the KMS server and as a result, renew the activation.
_______________________________________

 1- Activation via Online KMS Script:
    Run activate option whenever the system needs activation.
_______________________________________

 2- Activation via Desktop Context Menu:

   This method is exactly same as above but here we put the following files in,
   C:\ProgramData\Online_KMS_Activation\BIN\cleanosppx64.exe
   C:\ProgramData\Online_KMS_Activation\BIN\cleanosppx86.exe
   C:\ProgramData\Online_KMS_Activation\Activate_dcm.cmd
   C:\ProgramData\Online_KMS_Activation\Info.html

   and create registry entries in,
   HKCR\DesktopBackground\shell\Activate Windows - Office

   It creates an easy to reach Desktop context menu for the manual activation renewal.
_______________________________________

 3- Automatic KMS server Renewal via Task Scheduler:
   
   This method put the following files in,
   C:\ProgramData\Online_KMS_Activation\Activate_tsk.cmd
   C:\ProgramData\Online_KMS_Activation\Info.html

   And creates a scheduled task (Renewal) to run the script every 7 days.
   This task register the working KMS server and trigger activation command only for the installed 
   Volume products.

   The scheduled task runs only if the system is connected to the Internet.

____________________________________________________________________________________________________

   Remarks:
_______________________________________

 - With KMS Activation, you can update Windows/Office without any issues.

 - What is left in the system in the activation process?
   
   - Activation via Online KMS Script

	 If Renewal Task is installed: 
     After activation, it leaves the KMS Server IP in the registry, which helps you to get the
     global activation feature whereby the system auto-renews the activations.
     About files and scheduled task, it has been mentioned above.

	 If Renewal Task is NOT installed: 
     It leaves a non-existent IP 0.0.0.0 to avoid Office Not Genuine Banner issue.

 - This script includes the most-stable KMS servers (16) list from all over the world. The server 
   selection process is fully automatic. Script randomly select a server, tests if it's online, 
   if yes then apply the activation command, if fails, then retry this process maximum of total 
   4 times for a product. Such redundancy makes sure that we get the working KMS server any time.

 - If your system date is incorrect (beyond 180 days) and you are offline, the system will be 
   deactivated, but will automatically reactivate when you correct the system date. 

 - The advantage of Online KMS activation is that it doesn't need any KMS binary file and 
   system can be activated using some manual commands or transparent batch script files.
   So this is for those who don't like/have difficulties/trust issues in offline KMS because of its 
   binary files and antivirus detections.

   But if you prefer offline KMS then checkout an open-source activator,

====================================================================================================
   Office C2R 'Your license isn't genuine' notification banner:
====================================================================================================

 - Office Click-to-Run builds (since February 2021) that are activated with KMS checks the existence of the KMS server name in the registry.
 
 - If KMS server is not present, a banner is shown in Office programs notifying that "Office isn't licensed properly", see here.
 
 - Therefore in manual mode, KeyManagementServiceName value containing a non-existent IP address 0.0.0.0 will be kept in the below registry keys:
   HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion\SoftwareProtectionPlatform
   HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\WOW6432Node\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion\SoftwareProtectionPlatform
   This is perfectly fine to keep, and it does not affect Windows or Office activation.

   How does KMS activation work? Is there any downsides compared to genuine activation?

_______________________________________

   Activation Troubleshoot:
   Check Activation Troubleshoot option in the "Extras" section of the 'MAS' project.

_______________________________________

   Preactivation:
   For Windows preactivation at the time of Windows installation, check Extract $OEM$ Folder 
   option in the "Extras" section of the 'MAS' project.

_______________________________________

   How to undo the KMS activation for Windows? I want to activate with my own activation key.

   - Use uninstall option from the KMS script.

   - Open CMD as admin and enter your activation key (non KMS key) with the below command,
     slmgr /ipk *****-*****-*****-*****-*****

   - That's all, further process is not required.

   Office C2R Retail O365/2013/2016/2019/2021
________________________________________________________________

   Notes:

   These editions are only KMS-activatable for 45 days at max:
   Windows 10 Home edition variants  
   Windows 8.1 Core edition variants, Pro with Media Center, Pro Student

   These editions are only KMS-activatable for 30 days at max:
   Windows 8 Core edition variants, Pro with Media Center
   
   Office C2R Retail need volume conversion, script will convert it if needed.
   
   Supported Windows products do need volume conversion, only the GVLK (KMS key) is needed, which 
   the script will install accordingly.

   KMS Activation works in all (MBR, GPT, UEFI, BIOS) systems.

====================================================================================================
   Unsupported Products:
====================================================================================================

   Office MSI Retail 2010/2013
   Office UWP (Windows 10 Apps)

   Windows Editions which do not support KMS activation by design:  
   Windows Evaluation (EVAL) Editions  
   Windows 7 (Starter, HomeBasic, HomePremium, Ultimate)  
   Windows 10 (Cloud "S", IoTEnterprise, IoTEnterpriseS, ProfessionalSingleLanguage... etc)  
   Windows Server (Server Foundation, Storage Server, Home Server 2011... etc) 

   On some OEM systems, KMS activation on Windows 7 can not work due to unqualified BIOS
   Check details here https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/942962/

====================================================================================================
   Office C2R Retail to Volume conversion:
====================================================================================================

   By default, this activation script will convert Office C2R Retail to Volume.
   Office Retail must be converted to Volume first before it can be activated with KMS specifically, 
   Office Click-to-Run products, whether installed from ISO (e.g. ProPlus2019Retail.img) or 
   using Office Deployment Tool.

   Notes:

   Supported Click-to-Run products: Office 365, Office 2021, Office 2019, Office 2016, Office 2013
   Activated Office Retail products will be skipped from conversion
   Office 365 itself does not have volume licenses, therefore it will be converted to Office Mondo licenses
   Office Professional suite will be converted with Office ProPlus licenses
   Office HomeBusiness/HomeStudent suites will be converted with Office Standard licenses
   Office 2016 products will be converted with corresponding Office 2019 licenses
   If Office 2019 RTM licenses are not detected, Office 2016 licenses will be used instead

   On Windows 7, Office 2016/2019 licensing service require Universal C Runtime to work correctly
   UCRT is available in the latest Monthly Rollup, or the separate update KB3118401
   Additionally, Office programs themselves require recent Windows 7 updates to start properly
   
   If the automatic conversion did not work, or if you prefer to use the separate converter script:
   Office-C2R-Retail2Volume https://forums.mydigitallife.net/posts/1150042/

   You can also use other tools that can convert licensing:

   Online KMS Script is a fork of @abbodi1406's KMS_VL_ALL  forums.mydigitallife.net/posts/838808

   This fork's purpose is to avoid having any KMS binary files and activate Windows/Office using 
   only transparent batch script with online public KMS servers.

   Thanks to @RPO and @abbodi1406 for providing help in making of this fork.
