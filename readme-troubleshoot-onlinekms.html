______________________________

   in the bottom of this page.

 - Make sure the Internet is connected.

 - If you wish to remove Office and leftovers completely and start clean:
   Uninstall Office normally from Control Panel (Programs and Feature),
   Download Office Scrubber pack [forums.mydigitallife.net/posts/1466365/]

 - Can't activate Windows 7 with KMS: [Error 0xC004F035]
   Some OEM licensed computers cannot be activated with KMS on WINDOWS 7. 

   Quote from the MS page support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/942962
   Computers obtained through OEM channels that have an ACPI_SLIC table in the (BIOS) are 
   required to have a valid Windows marker in the same ACPI_SLIC table.
   ---Computers that have an ACPI_SLIC table without a valid Windows marker generate an error 
   when a volume edition of Windows 7 is installed.
